__fgeo.abundance__ calculates abundance, basal area and diversity.

## Installation

[Install all __fgeo__ packages in one step](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/index.html#installation)

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "forestgeo/fgeo.abundance")
```

For details on how to install packages from GitHub, see [this article](https://goo.gl/dQKEeg).

## Example

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(fgeo.tool)
library(fgeo.abundance)
```

Abundance

```{r}
# Your data may have multiple stems per treeid and even multiple measures per
# stemid (if trees have buttressess).
vft <- tribble(
  ~CensusID, ~TreeID, ~StemID, ~DBH, ~HOM,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   88,  130,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   10,  160,
          1,     "2",   "2.1",   20,  130,
          1,     "2",   "2.2",   30,  130,
)

# But you should count only the main stem of each tree
(main_stem <- pick_main_stem(vft))
abundance(main_stem)

# You may have data from multiple censuses
vft2 <- tibble::tribble(
  ~CensusID, ~TreeID, ~StemID, ~DBH, ~HOM,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   20,  130,
          1,     "1",   "1.2",   10,  160,  # Main stem
          2,     "1",   "1.1",   12,  130,
          2,     "1",   "1.2",   22,  130   # Main stem
)

# You can compute by groups
by_census <- group_by(vft2, CensusID)
(main_stems_by_census <- pick_main_stem(by_census))
abundance(main_stems_by_census)

# You may need to first subset data and then count
over20 <- filter(main_stems_by_census, DBH > 20)
abundance(over20)
```

Basal area

```{r}
vft <- tribble(
  ~CensusID, ~TreeID, ~StemID, ~DBH, ~HOM,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   88,  130,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   10,  160,
          1,     "2",   "2.1",   20,  130,
          1,     "2",   "2.2",   30,  130,
)

# You may need to pick the main stemid of each stem (if trees have buttressess)
(main_stemids <- pick_main_stemid(vft))
basal_area(main_stemids)

# You can compute by groups
basal_area(by_census)

ten_to_twenty <- filter(by_census, DBH >= 10, DBH <= 20)
basal_area(ten_to_twenty)
```
