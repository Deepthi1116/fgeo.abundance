\title{Count unique trees based on the dbh of their largest stem.}
\usage{
count_woods(.data, ...)

count_trees(.data)

count_saplings(.data)

count_saplings_and_trees(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A dataframe; particularly a ForestGEO census or ViewFullTable.}

\item{...}{Expressions to pick stems of specific \code{dbh} -- where \emph{stems}
refers to the largest stem of each tree.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with preserved groups (if any).
}
\description{
This functions count unique treeid by censusid (automatically) and any number
of additional grouping variables (via \code{dplyr::group_by()}. Data with
multi-stem trees is first collapsed by picking the stem (of each treeid) with
maximum dbh.
\itemize{
\item \code{count_woods()} is general and allows filtering data using any number of
expressions passed via the argument \code{...} to \code{dplyr::filter()}.
\item \code{count_trees()} is a shortcut that defines tress as stems of dbh of 100 mm
and above.
\item \code{count_samplings()} is a shortcut that defines saplings as stems of dbh of
between 10 mm inclusive and 100 mm exclusive.
