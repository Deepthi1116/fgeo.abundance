# Notes

* Recycle available examples and vignettes
* Show how similar or different these functions are compared to their __ctfs__' version.

# Overview

The goal of this vignette is to show how to calculate population metrics within and between censuses. 

# Metrics within a census

## Abundance, basal_area and boimass

xxx

# Metrics between two censuses

## Recruitment, Mortality, Growth

* Show how this is a step up in complexity: While abundance, biomass and basal area measure the properties in one census, here we address functions that measure change between two censuses.

### Recruitment 

* `recruitment()`
* `recruitment_df()` or `demography_df()`?
* messages by `check_if_all_dbh_is_na()`

### Mortality

### Growth
